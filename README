Buildroot
=========

Commands
--------

Show available configuration

	make list-defconfigs
	
Use rpi zero default configuration as base

	make raspberrypi0w_defconfig

Modify the default configuration (for example to add packages)

	make menuconfig
	
Modidy the kernel configuration (we set up printk and early printk in kernel
hacking menu)
	
	make linux-menuconfig
	
In the same manner, if needed

	make busybox-menuconfig
	make uboot-menuconfig
	
Settings changed 

	Bootloaders -> U-Boot (or build as a standalone, see previous section)
	
Build

	make all

Burn the image to SD card

	sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M status=progress
	
Then copy our own rpi config.txt to the SD Card as well as output/images/u-boot.bin
and boot.scr.uimg 

Extract config file for git (do not store other package config such as busybox)
	
	make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=../raspberrypi0w_defconfig

WiFi
----

Buildroot modification needed to enable wifi

	Hardware Handling -> Firmware -> rpi-wifi-firmware
	Networking applications -> wpa_supplicant
	Networking applications -> wpa_supplicant - Enable 80211 support

Also modify /etc/network/interfaces/etc/network/interfaces with

	auto wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet dhcp
		pre-up wpa_supplicant -D nl80211 -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
		post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant

and /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf with

	ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
	ap_scan=1

	network={
		ssid="My WLAN"
		psk="my_wlan_password"
	}

the wifi driver must be loaded before the networking init-scripts kick in
edit /etc/inittab and modprobe brcmfmac ourselves before rs scripts are ran

	# Load Wifi driver
	::sysinit:/sbin/modprobe brcmfmac 

	# now run any rc scripts
	::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

Check if brcmfmac driver is loaded

	lsmod

Set up BR2 env
--------------

We use buildroot as a submodule (version tagged 2020.11.1)

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/gbesnard/rpi-uboot-buildroot.git

and our customization are stored in an external tree

	make BR2_EXTERNAL=../khbx_brconfig list-defconfigs

From now on, definitions from the khbx_brconfig external tree will be used.
We can load our defconfig

	make khbxrpi0w_defconfig

and then build

	make all

save defconfig

	make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=../khbx_brconfig/khbxrpi0w_defconfig

We also use buildroot overlay system, and post build and post image script to 
automate our system generation.

Build Kernel module
-------------------

Buildroot built kernel module are stored at 

	output/target/lib/modules/5.4.51/extra/foobar_chrdev.ko

Force package rebuild

	make foobar_chrdev-dirclean && make foobar_chrdev-rebuild

U-Boot
======

Build as a standalone (can be build using buildroot)

	export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
	export ARCH=arm
	make rpi_0_w_defconfig 
	make -j8 -s

In the rpi boot partition, add the file u-boot.bin and change config.txt to 
load u-boot instead of the Linux kernel

	kernel=u-boot.bin

In u-boot prompt load kernel, passe bootargs params and boot at kernel address
using preloaded device tree. Set the system as read/write.

	mmc dev 0
	fatload mmc 0:1 ${kernel_addr_r} zImage
	setenv earlyprintk bootargs root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 \
		rw rootwait console=ttyAMA0,115200
	printenv
	md ${fdt_addr}
	bootz ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr}

To avoid writing it each time, it is store in boot.scr. This command will 
create a script to be copied into the SD boot partition

	mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n boot.scr -d boot.scr boot.scr.uimg

The device tree blob is loaded by the first stage bootloader in fdt_addr.
This should also be possible to be loaded from the U-Boot stage like this

	fatload mmc 0:1 ${fdt_addr} bcm2708-rpi-zero-w.dtb
	
but it seems the first stage rpi bootloader does some modification to the dtb 
before loading it, and a "raw" loaded dtb doesn't seem to work.

GPIO
====

Pinout
	
	Difference between "RPI pinout" and "Broadcom pinout"
	RPI header 38 ==> Raw line 20
	RPI header 40 ==> Raw line 21

Serial communication
====================

To enable serial communication, add in rpi boot config.txt 

	enable_uart=1

To monitor from Linux

	sudo screen -L /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

To be able to scroll up (switch to copy mode)

	Ctrl + A, then Escape

USB to TTL serial cable pinout

	RED     5V   ---------------  5V   4   (or use USB power)
	BLACK   GND  ---------------  GND  6
	WHITE   RX   ---------------  TX   8
	GREEN   TX   ---------------  RX   10

Ideas and improvements
======================

- Tweak with device tree to gain understanding.
- Build a simple character device kernel module.
- Try an update mechanism through U-Boot.
- Try to run a bare-metal application through U-Boot.
